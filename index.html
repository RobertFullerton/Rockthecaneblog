                                    <p>This is such an important one! When hungry all individuals need to know how to open their own food.</p>
                                    <p>Set the person up for success by teaching him how to open a variety of snacks and food containers such as chip bags, 
                                    applesauce, cookies, beef jerky, fruit cups, cheese sticks, gummies and whatever your child might enjoy.</p>
                                    <p>Teach your child to locate the part of the package that requires them to pinch and pull. Talk about how to make the 
                                    pinching motion involving his index finger touching the tip of his thumb.</p>
                                    <p>Consider using reusable sandwich type bags so that you only have to teach the skill of opening the bag once early 
                                    on and the child can be independent at getting out his own food during recess or lunch. </p>

                                    <p>Work on how to open and use tupperware so that the person can get their food from them at lunch.</p>
                                    <p>This is a lifetime skill so while the person is learning just focus on how to help him be independent at getting his own 
                                    food. Over time practice opening all type of food packages.</p>
                                    <p>Consider buying easier to eat items. For example, an apple sauce squeeze is easier and neater to eat then an apple sauce.</p>

                                        <img src="/img/tooth paste.png" alt="" class="img1 img-fluid float-left" height="400" width="300" />
                                        <p class="blog-post-meta">
                                            <p>Teach your child to get his own toothpaste by squeezing some in his hand and having him scoop the toothpaste from his 
                                            hand onto the toothbrush. That way he can feel it better.</p>
                                            <p> All younger kids might need additional brushing to get their teeth clean but let them try and work on learning anyway. You can always 
                                            finish up brushing at the end.</p>
                                            <p>Teach your child how to turn on the water so that they can access water to brush their teeth. Typically cold knobs are on the left and hot 
                                            is on the right. Try using concepts such as turn the right cold knob to the right going clockwise or turn the left knob to 7 o’clock to turn 
                                            on the hot water. Children are never too young to begin introducing these concepts.
                                            <a href="" class="">Link to applying toothpaste after vision loss</a></p>
                                            <p>I have seen some teachers who apply toothpaste to a plate and allow the child to scoop it off the plate.</p>
                                            <p>A softer toothbrush with wider handle might help a child who has sensory needs.</p> 
                                            <p>Keep all toothpaste related supplies in the same location so that the child knows how to locate them.</p>
                                            <p>Consider buying toothpaste that not only tastes good but is easier to apply. You might try a toothpaste that you can pump for instance 
                                            versus squeeze.</p>
                                            <p>Talk your child through the process. Use terms and concepts such as bottom molars, front teeth, right top teeth etc to describe where the 
                                            toothbrush needs to go.</p>
                                            <p>Use hand-under-hand to teach the child how to hold the toothbrush and explain the motion the need to make to brush their front top teeth. 
                                            For example, with your right hand have the bristles face towards your teeth and move your right hand left and right in motion so that you 
                                            brush your teeth clean.</p> 
                                            <p><a href="">Youtube video on Blind Life Hacks</a> from the Blind Spot that talks about just squeezing the toothpaste in your mouth. 
                                            <p><strong>Consider buying a toothpaste squeezer</strong> for the toothpaste so that it is easier to access.</p>
                                            <p>Make the experience fun and routine so that the child knows what is expected of them.</p>
                                            <p>Purchase a musical electric toothbrush so that your child has an idea of what is the appropriate amount of time to brush their teeth.s</p>
                                            <p>Consider buying an <strong>electric toothbrush</strong> that does most of the work for the person. 
                                            <p>Work on how to feel that the toothbrush is cleaning ALL of the teeth.</p>

                                    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Why Living Skills Matter</h2>
                                        <p class="blog-post-meta">
                                            <p>Welcome to my blog series about how to foster independent living skills (ILS) with your child who has multiple 
                                            impairments or is of preschool-age. As an Orientation and Mobility (O&M) Specialist, I am lucky enough to work 
                                            with individuals who have visual impairments entering the school system at age three, and I work closely with 
                                            them throughout their school careers. During my tenure, I started to pick up on a pattern of behavior when I 
                                            was assessing students.</p>
                                            <p>My students were learning the advanced O&M skills such as how to navigate a campus, cross streets and shop, 
                                            but they were unable to independently shower, get dressed, manage their clothing or accomplish several daily 
                                            living tasks. </p>
                                            <h2>My Startling Realization about Daily Living and Visual Impairments</h2>
                                            <p>I even had a 20-year-old student denied acceptance to weekend programs and adult programs 
                                            such as the Junior Blind of America because she could not shower herself. Don’t get me wrong. I collaborate with teachers and 
                                            parents regarding independent living skills and did so for the 20-year-old student throughout the years, but 
                                            I realized she was not working on the skills at home.</p>
                                            <h2>Discovering Independent Living CheckLists</h2>
                                            <p>I searched the internet to find practical information that I could provide for parents and stumbled 
                                            across the amazing Michigan Independent Living Skills (ILS) checklists. I realized that the list was just what 
                                            I needed to explain to parents how they can help their child at home.</p>
                                            <p>I started writing many ILS goals for my students’ to gain by next year. I met parents at their jobs, homes, Starbucks, 
                                            and in my office to go over the list and break down how they could help their child in every category. I met with high 
                                            school students and we discussed everything on the list. </p>
                                            <h2>Slow and Steady Progress in Independent Living Skills Goals</h2>
                                            <p>It took me over a year to go through each item and explain how parents could work on them at home. I realized that 
                                            I needed to expand the list instead of explaining each thing to 24 sets of parents. It would be more useful if I 
                                            created this blog series to help not only the families on my caseload but anyone else who was not sure how to get 
                                            started. Refrigerate toothpaste so that the person can feel it when it is placed on their finger, squeezed in their 
                                            mouth or squeezed in the palm of their hand. Different techniques work for different individuals! </p>
